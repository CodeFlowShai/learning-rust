# learning-rust

Welcome to my slow descent into madness.

This repository contains my personal experiments and chaos-driven adventures as I learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by poking at it with a metaphorical stick.  
No tutorials. No hand-holding. Just raw trial, error, and compiler tears.

## What is this?

A sandbox project for learning Rust from scratch by:
- Writing bad code on purpose.
- Reading compiler errors like ancient runes.
- Breaking things and pretending it's intentional.
- Avoiding the Rust Book out of pure stubbornness.

If you’re looking for elegant, idiomatic code, this ain’t it.  
But if you want to witness my journey into the warm embrace of madness, welcome!

## Structure

- `src/main.rs`: DAH CODE
- `Cargo.toml`: Where I pretend to know what dependencies are.
- `Cargo.lock`: The cargo cult's sacred artifact.

## Progress

- Installed Rust with 57 layers of path drama
- Created this repo to contain my crimes? Check!
- Make something useful? uhhh
- Be happy? nah
